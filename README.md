ü§ñ Langie - LangGraph Customer Support Agent
A sophisticated customer support workflow agent built with LangGraph, featuring 11-stage graph-based processing with state persistence and MCP (Model Context Protocol) client integration.

üìã Project Overview
Langie is a structured and logical LangGraph Agent that processes customer support tickets through a comprehensive 11-stage workflow. Each stage represents a clear phase of the customer support process, with abilities executed through MCP clients connecting to Atlas and Common servers.

üéØ Key Features
Graph-based Workflow: 11 well-defined stages with clear transitions
State Persistence: Maintains state variables across all stages
MCP Integration: Seamless integration with Atlas and Common MCP servers
Hybrid Execution: Both deterministic and non-deterministic stage execution
Comprehensive Logging: Detailed execution logs and performance metrics
Dynamic Decision Making: Runtime orchestration based on context and scoring

üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites
bash
pip install asyncio logging dataclasses typing datetime uuid enum
Basic Usage
python
import asyncio
from langie_agent import LangieAgent

# Sample customer request
sample_input = {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com",
    "query": "I was charged twice for my subscription this month. I need a refund for the duplicate charge.",
    "priority": "high",
    "ticket_id": "TKT-2024001"
}

# Initialize and run agent
async def main():
    agent = LangieAgent()
    result = await agent.execute_workflow(sample_input)
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

asyncio.run(main())
üìä Input Schema
json
{
  "customer_name": "string (required)",
  "email": "string (required, email format)",
  "query": "string (required)",
  "priority": "string (low|medium|high|critical, default: medium)",
  "ticket_id": "string (format: TKT-XXXXXXXX)"
}

üß© Stage Details
Non-Deterministic Stage: DECIDE ‚öñÔ∏è
The DECIDE stage implements dynamic orchestration:

Solution Evaluation: Scores potential solutions (1-100)
Dynamic Decision: If score < 90, escalates to human agent
Payload Update: Records decision outcomes
python
# Example decision logic
if best_score < 90:
    # Execute escalation_decision ability
    escalate_to_human_agent()
else:
    # Proceed with automated resolution
    continue_workflow()
üìù State Management
The agent maintains persistent state across all stages:

python
class WorkflowState:
    customer_name: str
    email: str
    query: str
    priority: str
    ticket_id: str
    current_stage: str
    stage_results: Dict[str, Any]
    final_payload: Dict[str, Any]
    execution_log: List[Dict[str, Any]]
üîß Configuration
The agent uses a comprehensive YAML configuration file (agent_config.yaml) that defines:

Input schema validation
MCP server endpoints and capabilities
Stage definitions and execution modes
State management rules
Error handling policies
Logging configuration
üìà Execution Logging
Every ability execution is logged with:

json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "stage": "UNDERSTAND",
  "ability": "parse_request_text",
  "server": "common",
  "result": {...}
}
üéØ Sample Output
json
{
  "ticket_id": "TKT-2024001",
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com"
  },
  "request": {
    "query": "I was charged twice for my subscription...",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "processing": {
    "stages_completed": 11,
    "execution_time": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "results": {
    "UNDERSTAND": {
      "parse_request_text": {...},
      "extract_entities": {...}
    },
    "DECIDE": {
      "solution_evaluation": {"best_score": 95},
      "escalation_decision": {"escalate": false}
    }
  },
  "execution_log": [...]
}
